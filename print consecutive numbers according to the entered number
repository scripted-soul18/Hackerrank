Task:-


The included code stub will read an integer, , from STDIN.

Without using any string methods, try to print the following:
1 <= n <= 150
Note that "" represents the consecutive values in between.
In simple words,we have asked to print such a function which will print 1 to n integers according to the input user has given.

Code:-
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    1<=n<=150
    def print_numbers(n):
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(i, end="")
        
    print_numbers(n)
